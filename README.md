## üîç Advanced SQL Tasks (15)

Each query focuses on real-world problems like:

- Extracting insights from genres
- Working with array-based text columns
- Date filtering and ordering
- Text matching using ILIKE
- String parsing with PostgreSQL functions
- Aggregation with grouping
- Filtering on calculated values

These are written in standard *PostgreSQL* syntax.

## üõ† How to Use

1. Import the CSV into your PostgreSQL database.
2. Run the schema.sql file to create the table.
3. Load data using the COPY command or import tool.
4. Execute queries from queries.sql.
